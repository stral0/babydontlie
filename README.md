Analysis of the Serbian biggest advertising platform for used vehicles (www.polovniautomobili.com) and trying to see if those mileages shown there are trustworthy. 

# Libraries used:
1. BeautifulSoup for parsing the html pages.
2. MatplotLib for visualization of the results.
3. Other python3 libraries.

# Results:
We can see how most owners have listed around 180k-200k mileages, no matter the production year of their respected vehicles.

I devided the vehicles in 
### 3 categories: 
1. Made before 2000, 
2. Made between 2001 and 2010, and
3. Made in 2011 or later. 

All of them had almost the same results, which show us that this parameter is not trustworthy.
